# Mergen

This repository provides the Manchu text data augmented with the methodology introduced in [Mergen: The First Manchu-Korean Machine Translation Model Trained on Augmented Data](https://aclanthology.org/2023.mrl-1.10.pdf).

The data augmentation follows the steps described in the figure below.
